# Student Portal Demo

This is a demo project for a *Student Portal Application*.

## Idea
The Student Portal will provide a digital platform for students to:
- Log in securely with their student credentials.
- View their personal profile, attendance, and academic records.
- Access timetables, course materials, and notices.
- Check examination results and grades.
- Communicate with teachers or administrators.

This repository is just a starting point to demonstrate the concept. Future development can include frontend (React/Angular), backend (Node.js/Java/Python), and database (MySQL/MongoDB).
